<h3>The History</h3>
<p>Designed by Peter Moore, the Nike Air Jordan 1 released in Michael Jordan's rookie season in the NBA. The Jordan 1 released in many different colorways, the most popular being the Bred colorway and the Chicago colorway. And while the bred was love by many for its "banned theme" the Chicago was loved and defined by what Michael Jordan did with it on court. The most famous example would be dropping a historic 63 points in a playoff game against Larry Bird and the 80's Celtics.</p>

<h4>Chicago</h4>
This particular colorway has only released 4 times since 1985 and has been known to have some of the best materials in each time of its release.
